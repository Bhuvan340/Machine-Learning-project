# Sign Language Interpreter using SVM and CNN
This project aims to develop an efficient Sign Language Interpreter leveraging Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The system is designed to recognize and translate hand gestures used in sign language into readable text or speech, making communication easier for the hearing and speech impaired. By combining traditional machine learning methods (SVM) for gesture classification and advanced deep learning techniques (CNN) for image recognition, this project ensures high accuracy and adaptability in interpreting complex hand movements. The interpreter can be trained with a custom dataset of sign language gestures, making it a versatile solution across different sign languages.
